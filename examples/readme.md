## Get Stellar Parameters and Abundances for the Main Red Star Sample

ASPCAP parameters, element abundances, and uncertainties for all stars in the main red star sample with reliable abundances.

- Following the advice on [Using Stellar Parameters](https://sdss.org/dr17/irspec/parameters) and [Using Stellar Abundances](https://sdss.org/dr17/irspec/abundances), quanitites that are not trustworthy will have a series of bits set in [APOGEE_ASPCAPFLAG](https://sdss.org/dr17/irspec/apogee-bitmasks/#APOGEE_ASPCAPFLAG:ASPCAPstarlevelbitmask) or [APOGEE_STARFLAG](https://sdss.org/dr17/irspec/apogee-bitmasks/#APOGEE_STARFLAG,APOGEE_ANDFLAG:APOGEEstarlevelbitmask).
- Following the advice on Using [Targets/Samples](https://sdss.org/dr17/irspec/targettingbits/), the [APOGEE_EXTRATARG](https://sdss.org/dr17/irspec/apogee-bitmasks/#EXTRATARG:basictargetinginformation) will have no bits set if the star is in the main red star sample.
