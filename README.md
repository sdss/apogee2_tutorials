# APOGEE2 Examples & Tutorials 

This Repository hosts [Examples](examples) & [Tutorials](tutorials) using APOGEE2 data from DR17. 

- [Examples](examples) is affiliated with the [Web Documetation Examples](https://testng.sdss.org/dr17/irspec/catalogs/) and provides relatively simple sample selection and plotting examples for generic applications. Typically the examples require only one data type, usually the summary AllStar file.  
- [Tutorials](tutorials) is affiliated with the [Web Documetation Tutorials](https://testng.sdss.org/dr17/irspec/apogee-tutorials/) and instructs on how to conduct more in depth investigations that may require mutltiple data files, Value-Added-Catalogs (VACs), and results from papers. Because these will require very specific use cases, we have separated them from the more general [Examples](examples).
