# apogee2_tutorials
Place for user-contributed code that use APOGEE-2 data (and data models) to do common user tasks.

The idea is to host a number of python notebooks (other code is welcome too) that mimic common tasks with APOGEE-2 DR17 data (e.g., things on the Examples and Tutorials pages in the web docs).
